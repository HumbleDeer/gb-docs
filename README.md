# Welcome to Mainsail

<mark style="color:red;">**Mainsail.**</mark> A modern and responsive user interface for Klipper. Control and monitor your printer from everywhere, from any device.

<mark style="color:red;">**Easy to use.**</mark>** ** The focus lies on both anticipating what users may need to do and ensuring that the user interface contains elements that are easily accessible, understandable, and user-friendly to make those actions easier.

<mark style="color:red;">**Always one step ahead.**</mark> We work closely with developers of other projects so that functions can already be implemented early on.

<mark style="color:red;">**100% open source.**</mark> Anyone can join, anyone can contribute.
