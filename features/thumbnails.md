## Cura

The Cura plugin "Cura2Moonraker" is required for this. You can find this plugin and a install guide here: [Cura2MoonrakerPlugin](https://github.com/emtrax-ltd/Cura2MoonrakerPlugin)

## ideaMaker (since v4.2.1)

To enable thumbnails, open the `Advanced` tab in the `printer settings`, enable the `GCode Thumbnails for Octoprint and Mainsail` option and enter your preferred _square format_ image size in the `Resolution` fields (e.g. `400 X 400`). It's necessary that the thumbnail width and height resolution is equal.
