# Backgrounds

There are two background images that can be used in Mainsail. The first is in the sidebar and the second is in the main section.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/sidebar-main (1).jpg>)

You can upload a new background image using the file manager located in `Settings > Machine`.

## Sidebar background image <a href="#sidebar-background-image" id="sidebar-background-image"></a>

Load the background image into your .theme folder and name it `sidebar-background.<extension>`.

| Filename               | sidebar-background        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Valid file extensions  | .jpg, .png, .gif and .svg |
| Recommended image size | 300x1000px                |

## Main background image <a href="#main-background-image" id="main-background-image"></a>

Upload a background image into your .theme folder and name it `main-background.<extension>`.

| Filename              | main-background           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Valid file extensions | .jpg, .png, .gif and .svg |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Please note**: The background image is stretched to cover the entire area by default. For example, if you want a repeating pattern, you will also need to use custom CSS to style it correctly.
