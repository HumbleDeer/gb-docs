## Send commands <a href="#send-commands" id="send-commands"></a>

Start typing in the Console. To submit a command press Enter key or click on the paper airplane in the input field.

If you press the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">TAB</mark> key, the command will be completed to the next possible position. If there are several possibilities, you will get a list of choices. You can either click on a command to complete it, or just keep typing and press <mark style="background-color:yellow;">TAB</mark> key to complete it again.
