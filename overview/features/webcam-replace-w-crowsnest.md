# Webcam

One or more webcam streams can be added to Mainsail.

These streams can be displayed

* on the dashboard.
* on a separate webcam page.
* on the print farm overview.

For being able to add a stream to Mainsail, it must be available as a so-called "MJPEG stream".

So either you have a network camera that offers such a stream by itself, or you use a conventional webcam (USB camera, Raspberry Pi Camera, â€¦) that is connected to your system. For a non-network camera, you need to install a streamer software on your system.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
[MainsailOS ](https://app.gitbook.com/o/O2j4rN2JOaGEeS1KBjXz/s/HZGYoL7ogomNyBLNEpEJ/)comes preinstalled with [Crowsnest](https://app.gitbook.com/o/O2j4rN2JOaGEeS1KBjXz/s/qXE1OQLsr0XFNbT54RTY/) as streamer. If you wish to install Crowsnest on your system, or need assistance in configuring Crowsnest, please refer to its documentation.
{% endhint %}

Once such a stream is available, you only have to configure it in the Mainsail settings. The procedure can be found here.
