# Webcam

## Views

These streams can be displayed in various places:

### Dashboard

The dashboard panel can be moved, collapsed or entirely hidden. For more information see the [dashboard organization](dashboard-organisation.md).

### Webcam page

A separate webcam entry can be added to the navigation. This can be configured in the [UI settings](../settings/ui-settings.md).

### Print farm overview



## Options

In case of more than one webcam is configured on a printer, all cameras are displayed in an overview. However, it is also possible to switch to a single camera, using the drop-down menu in the panel header.
