Go to the [settings](./) and select the Dashboard category.

There, the different elements can be selected and deselected and moved around.

Please note that different settings can be set **for each device class**. The device classes also have **different column layouts**. So, for example, it is possible to hide some panels on mobile devices that are displayed on desktops, in a different order.
