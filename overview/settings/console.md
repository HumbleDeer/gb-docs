## Direction <a href="#direction" id="direction"></a>

Change the direction of the console output. From top to bottom, or vice versa.

This also affects whether the input field is located at the top or at the bottom.

## Entry-Design <a href="#entry-design" id="entry-design"></a>

Switch the appearance of console entries.

At the moment, there is “default” and “compact”. Compact, comes without separators and smaller line spacing.

## Height <a href="#height" id="height"></a>

Specify the height of the console panel on the dashboard in pixels, so that it fits better into your dashboard layout.

## Console Filters <a href="#console-filters" id="console-filters"></a>

With console filters, you can suppress entries from the console.

The filters can be enabled and disabled in the settings or directly in the console panel via the funnel icon.

Mainsail lets you define, edit, delete your own filters, but also comes with predefined ones:

### &#x20;Hide Temperatures <a href="#hide-temperatures" id="hide-temperatures"></a>

Filters all temperature status messages in the console.

### &#x20;Hide Timelapse <a href="#hide-timelapse" id="hide-timelapse"></a>

Only the G-Code messages are filtered.

The status messages can be switched in the Timelapse settings.

### &#x20;Custom Filters <a href="#custom-filters" id="custom-filters"></a>
