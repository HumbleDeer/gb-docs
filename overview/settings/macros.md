# Macros

## Simple Mode

This mode is very simple to manage your `gcode_macro`s. You can only hide macros which one you don't want to see on the dashboard. All macros are displayed alphabetically in a panel on the dashboard.

## Expert Mode

In this mode, you can create individual groups. Each group is displayed as a separate panel on the dashboard and can be positioned independently in the dashboard.

Each group can then be individually equipped, and the visibility can be individually adjusted.
